Welcome to Competitive Programming with Nishant – your one-stop resource for mastering C++, STL, Data Structures, and Algorithms through well-known problems and hands-on problem solving.

“Programming isn’t about what you know; it’s about what you can figure out.”
— Chris Pine

Why This Repo?

In the realm of competitive programming, efficiency and clarity of code can be the difference between victory and timeout. This repository is maintained to help you:
	•	Master STL: Learn how to leverage the C++ Standard Template Library with clear examples.
	•	Strengthen Data Structures & Algorithms: Dive into problems that build both intuition and technical skills.
	•	Improve Problem Solving: Tackle well-known challenges, learn new techniques, and iterate over your solutions.

Whether you’re an aspiring coder or a seasoned programmer looking to refine your skills, you’ll find practical examples, useful explanations, and challenges designed to push you to your next level.

A Little Humor to Keep You Going

Why did the C++ programmer bring his vector to work? Because he wanted to keep his elements in order—unlike his coffee breaks!
